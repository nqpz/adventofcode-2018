# Advent of Code 2018

My solution to the programming tasks at https://adventofcode.com/2018

Just run `make` in each directory.  The answers to each part 1 and part
2 will be output to `answer1` and `answer2`, respectively.

## Strategies:

  1. **UNROLL EVERYTHING**
  2. Unroll everything.
  3. Use [Futhark](http://futhark-lang.org).
